== How to use the Pipeline Maven Plugin with Docker? (since version 3.0.3)

Since the version 1.14 of the Docker Pipeline plugin, "withMaven"
requires to

* Either prepend the '[.code]``MVN_CMD_DIR``' environment variable to the
'[.code]``PATH``' environment variable in every '[.code]``sh``' step that invokes
'[.code]``mvn``' (e.g.
"``sh 'export PATH=$MVN_CMD_DIR:$PATH && mvn clean deploy'`` ").
* Or use Takari's Maven Wrapper (e.g. "sh './mvnw clean deploy'")

If omitted, the Maven settings file and Mven global settings file will
not be injected in the Maven execution.

=== Using "[.code]``withMaven``" with "``+docker.image(...).inside{...}+``" and a Jenkins Scripted Pipeline 

*Prepending MVN_CMD_DIR to PATH*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
node("linux-agent-running-docker") { // Linux agent with the Docker daemon
    docker.image('maven').inside { // Docker image with Maven installed
        withMaven(...) {
            git "https://github.com/cyrille-leclerc/my-jar.git"
            sh "export PATH=$MVN_CMD_DIR:$PATH && mvn clean deploy" // 'mvn' command: need to add the $MVN_CMD_DIR to $PATH
        }
    }
}
``` 

**Using Takari's Maven Wrapper mvnw**

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
node("linux-agent-running-docker") { // Linux agent with the Docker daemon
    docker.image('openjdk:8-jdk').inside { // Docker image with Java installed
        withMaven(...) {
            git "https://github.com/cyrille-leclerc/my-jar.git"
            sh "./mvnw clean deploy" // 'mvnw' command (e.g. "./mvnw deploy")
        }
    }
}

=== Using "[.code]``withMaven``" with "``+docker.image(...).inside{...}+``" to a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline 

TODO provide a sample with Jenkins Declarative Pipeline

=== Sample message displayed in the build logs when using withMaven in a Docker Pipeline execution environment

Warning message displayed in the logs when invoking withMaven within
Docker Pipeline:

 [withMaven] WARNING: "withMaven(){...}" step running within "docker.image('image').inside {...}". Since the Docker Pipeline Plugin version 1.14, you MUST:
 [withMaven] * Either prepend the 'MVN_CMD_DIR' environment variable to the 'PATH' environment variable in every 'sh' step that invokes 'mvn' (e.g. "sh 'export PATH=$MVN_CMD_DIR:$PATH && mvn clean deploy' ").

== How to disable the Maven Event Spy injected by the Pipeline Maven Plugin in Maven builds?

It may be convenient to temporarily disable the Maven Event Spy of the
Jenkins Pipeline Maven plugin, for example for troubleshooting purpose.

You can disable the Maven Event Spy of the Jenkins Pipeline Maven plugin
(making it no-op) doing one of the following:

* Setting the environment variable "[.code]``JENKINS_MAVEN_AGENT_DISABLED``" to
"[.code]``true``" in the job execution

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
...
withMaven() {
   sh """
export JENKINS_MAVEN_AGENT_DISABLED=true
mvn package
"""
}
----

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
...
withEnv(['JENKINS_MAVEN_AGENT_DISABLED=true']) {
   sh "mvn package"
}
----

* Adding the system property
"[.code]``-Dorg.jenkinsci.plugins.pipeline.maven.eventspy.JenkinsMavenEventSpy.disabled=true``"
to the invocation of the mvn build

== Why do I see messages "``+[WARNING] Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS...+``" in the build logs?

The Jenkins Pipeline Maven Plugin uses the "[.code]``JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS``"
environment variable to pass options to subsequent Maven builds such as
the actual release build when invoking
"[.code]``mvn release:prepare release:perform``". The plugins passes the
properties "[.code]``-Dmaven.ext.class.path``" and
"[.code]``-Dorg.jenkinsci.plugins.pipeline.maven.reportsFolder``".

When using the "[.code]``JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS``", the JVM outputs a message during
its initialization.

With the Jenkins Pipeline Maven Plugin, this message looks like:

 [WARNING] Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -Dmaven.ext.class.path="/path/to/workspace/...@tmp/withMaven.../pipeline-maven-spy.jar" -Dorg.jenkinsci.plugins.pipeline.maven.reportsFolder="/path/to/workspace/...@tmp"

is not possible to disable this warning message

== My downstream pipelines don't get triggered even if I use "Build whenever a SNAPSHOT dependency is built"

A common reason why downstream pipelines don't get triggered when using
"Build whenever a SNAPSHOT dependency is built" is that the upstream
pipeline is using "mvn install" when the Jenkins Pipeline Maven
integration is configured to trigger pipelines on "mvn deploy".

To configure the Jenkins Pipeline Maven integration to trigger
downstream pipelines on "mvn install":

* Either change the default configuration:
 ** Navigate to "Manage Jenkins / Global Tools Configuration"
 ** Click on "Add Publisher" and select "Pipeline Graph Publisher"
 ** In the section "Downstream Pipeline Triggers", change the the
"Maven lifecycle threshold" from "deploy" to "install"

image:https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/99451377/pipeline-graph-publisher-maven-lifecycle.png?version=3&modificationDate=1558992519000&api=v2[]{height="250"}

* Or in the script of the upstream pipeline, configure
"``+withMaven(options: [pipelineGraphPublisher(lifecycleThreshold: 'install')]) {...}+``"

== How can I troubleshoot problems of trigger of downstream pipelines

* The Pipeline Maven Plugin uses the Jenkins log levels (see
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logging#Logging-LogsinJenkins[here])
to output additional troubleshooting information in the pipeline
build logs (the "Console Output" menu of the build)
* To output additional troubleshooting information about the  trigger
of downstream pipelines, enable in "Manage Jenkins / System Log"
(docs
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logging#Logging-LogsinJenkins[here]) 
the following loggers at a level FINE or FINER or more:
 ** org.jenkinsci.plugins.pipeline.maven.publishers.PipelineGraphPublisher
 ** org.jenkinsci.plugins.pipeline.maven.listeners.DownstreamPipelineTriggerRunListener
* Re run the pipeline that is supposed to trigger downstream
pipelines.
* Look at the pipeline build logs ("Console Output" menu), ensure that
the build is completed and that the following message is displayed
in the logs: "[withMaven] downstreamPipelineTriggerRunListener -
completed in XXX ms". Troubleshooting details are added

== How do I capture the log file generated by the Jenkins Maven Event Spy

You can archive the XML log file generated by the Jenkins Maven Event
Spy creating the marker file ".archive-jenkins-maven-event-spy-logs".

Sample:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
withMaven() {
    sh "mvn package"
    writeFile file: '.archive-jenkins-maven-event-spy-logs', text: ''
} // will discover the marker file ".archive-jenkins-maven-event-spy-log" and will archive the maven event spy log file maven-spy-....log
----

== How do I check the Maven settings in use by my build

You can dump the effective Maven settings of your pipeline using the
Maven Help plugin and the
"http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-help-plugin/effective-settings-mojo.html[help:effective-settings]"
goal

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
withMaven(){
   mvn help:effective-settings
}
----

== How can I reduce the footprint of the database of the Jenkins Pipeline Maven Plugin?

The Jenkins pipeline Maven plugin uses a database to trigger downstream
pipelines when a snapshot is built.

For production grade deployments, a MySQL database is needed instead of
the embedded H2 database. My SQL 5.6+, Amazon Aurora MySQL and MariaDB
10.2+ have been successfully tested.

To reduce the usage of the database, disable the "Pipeline Graph
Publisher" navigating to "Manage Jenkins / Global Tool Configuration /
Pipeline Maven Configuration" then clicking on "Add Publisher Options",
selecting "Pipeline Graph Publisher" and checking the "disabled"
checkbox.

height="250"}

== Why do I see messages "[withMaven] One or multiple Maven executions have been ignored..." in the build logs?

The message "[withMaven] One or multiple Maven executions have been
ignored by the Jenkins Pipeline Maven Plugin because they have been
interrupted before completion..." because one or several Maven execution
(e.g. "[.code]``mvn deploy``") have been interrupted before they could gracefully
complete.

The event "[.code]``org.apache.maven.eventspy.EventSpy#close()``" has not been
invoked on the Maven event spies.

This interruption usually happens because the mvn process has been
killed by the Operating System, typically for memory constraints in
Docker or cgroups environments. Another cause is a "[.code]``kill -9``" during
the build.

== Why do I see messages "javax.xml.parsers.FactoryConfigurationError: Provider for class javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory cannot be created"

This error is caused by the installation of another plugin that pulls an
outdated version of Apache Xerces. That pulls a version of Apache Xerces
that is not compatible with the version of the JVM. Typically, Xerces
2.6 will not be compatible with a JDK 8 due to changes in the JAXP API
(sample: https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-47486[JENKINS-47486] -
Getting issue details... STATUS ).

The solution is to get this plugin updated so that it uses a more recent
of Xerces that would be compatible with the JDK.

To identify the plugin that is pulling an outdated version of a JAXP
implementation (typically Xerces), navigate to the Jenkins Script
Console ("Manage Jenkins" then "Script Console") and execute the
following groovy script:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
String className = "org.apache.xerces.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl"

Class klass
try {
  klass = Class.forName(className)
} catch (Exception e) {
  println("Exception trying to load " + className + " from the system classloader, try the thread context classloader " + e)
  // contextClassLoader should not work but let's try it.
  klass = Class.forName(className, false, Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader())
}

java.security.CodeSource codeSource = klass.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource()

if (codeSource == null) {
  println(klass.toString() + " -> source not found")
} else {
  println(klass.toString() + " -> " + codeSource.getLocation());
}
----

The output message will show from which plugin the XercesParser is
loaded. Sample with a plugin "my_plugin" that would load an outdated
2.6.2 version of Xerces:

 class org.apache.xerces.jaxp.DocumentBuilderFactoryImpl -> file:/var/lib/jenkins/plugins/my_plugin/WEB-INF/lib/xercesImpl-2.6.2.jar 

== How to use Maven build data in generated emails

It is possible to use informations generated by Maven pipelines in
emails generated by the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Email-ext+plugin[Jenkins Email Ext
Plugin].

    Collection<org.jenkinsci.plugins.pipeline.maven.MavenArtifact> generatedArtifacts = currentBuild.rawBuild.getAction(org.jenkinsci.plugins.pipeline.maven.publishers.MavenReport.class).getGeneratedArtifacts();
    for (org.jenkinsci.plugins.pipeline.maven.MavenArtifact generatedArtifact:generatedArtifacts) {
        if (generatedArtifact.isDeployed()) {

            deployed= deployed.concat(generatedArtifact.getUrl())
            deployed = deployed.concat("===")
            deployed = deployed.concat(generatedArtifact.getShortDescription())
            deployed = deployed.concat(",")
        }

    }
    return deployed
}
